# hackjunction-multitaction-demo
A demo project for HackJunction to demonstrate the Multitaction multitouch displays (www.multitaction.com).

There are two separate demos available: 
  1. Unity application which uses TUIO for receiving the touch input
  2. C++ application which uses native Cornerstone SDK
  
See some [use cases](http://www.multitaction.com/showroom/) for inspiration :)
